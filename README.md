Brainrot is a meme-inspired programming language that translates common programming keywords into internet slang and meme references. It's built using Flex (lexical analyzer) and Bison (parser generator), making it a fun way to learn about language processing and compiler design.

## 🤔 What is Brainrot?

Brainrot is a C-like programming language where traditional keywords are replaced with popular internet slang. For example:

- `void` → `skibidi`
- `int` → `rizz`
- `for` → `flex`
- `return` → `bussin`

## 📋 Requirements

To build and run the Brainrot compiler, you'll need:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer)
- Bison (Parser Generator)

### Installation on Different Platforms

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc flex bison libfl-dev
```

#### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S gcc flex bison
```

#### macOS (using Homebrew)

```bash
brew install gcc flex bison
```

Some macOS users are experiencing an error related to `libfl`. First, check if `libfl` is installed at:

```
/opt/homebrew/lib/libfl.dylib  # For Apple Silicon
/usr/local/lib/libfl.dylib  # For Intel Macs
```

And if not, you have to find it and symlink to it. Find it using:

```
find /opt/homebrew -name "libfl.*"  # For Apple Silicon
find /usr/local -name "libfl.*"  # For Intel Macs
```

And link it with:

```
sudo ln -s /path/to/libfl.dylib /opt/homebrew/lib/libfl.dylib  # For Apple Silicon
sudo ln -s /path/to/libfl.dylib /usr/local/lib/libfl.dylib  # For Intel Macs
```

## 🚀 Building the Compiler

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/araujo88/brainrot.git
cd brainrot
```

2. Generate the parser and lexer:

```bash
bison -d -Wcounterexamples lang.y -o lang.tab.c
flex -o lang.lex.c lang.l
```

3. Compile the compiler:

```bash
gcc -o brainrot lang.tab.c lex.yy.c ast.c -lfl
```

Alternatively, simply run:

```bash
make
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Create a Brainrot source file (e.g., `hello.brainrot`):

```c
skibidi main {
    yapping("Hello, World!");
    bussin 0;
}
```

2. Run your Brainrot program:

```bash
./brainrot < hello.brainrot
```

### Builtin functions

- `yapping(string)`: equivalent to `puts(const char *str)`
- `baka(string)`: equivalent to `fprintf(stderr, const char *format, ...)`

### Operators

The language supports basic arithmetic operators:

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `=` Assignment
- `<` Less than
- `>` Greater than
- `&&` Logical AND
- `||` Logical OR

## ⚠️ Limitations

Current limitations include:

- No support for increment/decrement operators (++/--)
- Limited support for complex expressions
- No support for functions other than main
- Basic error reporting
